### What I learned

This is the third challenge that I do all by myself,  don't following any tutorials.  I can see that I'm improving. I found some difficults but I did some researches and manage to complete it. 

I was focusing in the use of relative measure units so I tested  *rem*.  It was a bit confusing at the begining because I was used to use *px* but I think I've done a good job. After using *rem* it was SO easer to make the site responsive. 

### Continued development

Once I feel prepared and satisfied with my html and css skills I'll move on to the study of JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [Background Problem](https://www.devmedia.com.br/css-background/38313) - This helped me with a repeat problem in the body background pattern. I didn't know how to fix it so this site was really helpful. 

- [Centralizing ](https://www.devmedia.com.br/como-centralizar-divs-em-html-e-css/37568) - In this research I finally understood what to do to centralize an element without use fixed measure units like *px* on height.  

- [REM Unit](https://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/40458/qual-%C3%A9-a-relatividade-da-unidade-rem) - This question helped me to understand how unity *rem* work.
